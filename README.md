**INTRODUCTION**

Modern vehicle Controller Area Networks (CANs) have increasingly complex designs that make them highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. Most traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), which are static model-based, struggle to adapt to new and evolving threats in dynamic environments.
Motivated by this challenge, our project proposes a novel reconfigurable IDS based on Transfer Learning (TL) to improve the security of vehicular networks using CAN. This approach combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with other machine learning techniques, enabling the system to dynamically adapt to emerging threats without requiring an extensive retraining process.
This method significantly enhances the detection of new and unknown attacks while maintaining high accuracy and efficiency. While previous work has demonstrated the potential of TL in improving IDS performance, our research extends these findings to provide a more generalizable and resilient security approach for increasingly connected and vulnerable automotive systems.
