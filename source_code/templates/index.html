    <h2>Welcome to Adaptive IDS</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Adaptive IDS, a state-of-the-art Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to secure modern connected and autonomous vehicles from evolving cyber threats. With the increasing reliance on Controller Area Networks (CAN) for vehicle communication, the risk of cyberattacks has grown significantly. Our IDS uses Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning to provide real-time monitoring, detection, and mitigation of malicious activities within the CAN network. Whether it's Denial of Service (DoS), Fuzzy, RPM Spoofing, or Gear Spoofing attacks, our system ensures robust vehicle security with over 99% accuracy and a 65% reduction in computational overhead compared to traditional IDS solutions.</p>

    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>The Adaptive IDS system is built using a Hybrid AI model that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for spatial pattern detection and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for analyzing temporal sequences in CAN traffic. This hybrid approach enables early threat detection and high-precision attack classification, minimizing the chances of false positives. Transfer Learning is employed to allow the system to adapt dynamically to new attack vectors, ensuring long-term reliability with minimal retraining efforts. The dataset used for training includes real-world CAN traffic data, allowing the system to learn and generalize attack patterns effectively. The IDS is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and scalable, making it suitable for modern and next-generation smart vehicles.</p>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
